            text1="Art is perhaps one of the most well-known and well-loved art styles throughout history and for good reason.
            It is, after all, a reimagination of sorts that “popped up” and took inspiration from mass or popular culture, particularly American consumerist culture, hence the name.
            This movement started in the mid-1950s and reached its height in the 1960s. This particular art style is characterized by the use of bold colours and the use of realistic or even hyper-realistic imagery. 
            Among the methods used by artists of this time included silk screening to produce works faster, akin to mass consumption."
